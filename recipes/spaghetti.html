<h2>Description</h2>
<p>If your tired of the traditional spaghetti noodles with sauce poured over, give this one a try. This is the only way my family will eat their spaghetti.</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>½ pound ground beef</li>
    <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
    <li>2 (8 ounce) cans tomato sauce</li>
    <li>1½ cups water</li>
    <li>1½ teaspoons salt</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon dried parsley</li>
    <li>½ pinch dried basil</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon black pepper</li>
    <li>4 ounces uncooked spaghetti</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>In a large skillet over medium heat, brown the ground beef with the onion until all pink is gone; drain.</li>
    <li>Stir in tomato sauce, water, salt, parsley, basil and pepper; mix well. Heat until sauce boils. Break spaghetti in half and drop into sauce a little at a time. Cover and turn to low.</li>
    <li>Cook until spaghetti is tender, approximately 20 to 25 minutes. Stir occasionally to keep from sticking to pan and from noodles sticking together. Add water, 1/2 to 1 cup, if it starts to dry out and noodles are not cooked.</li>
